1. In this assignment, I have used ipython notebooks, clustering algorithms has one notebook and each dimensionality reduction algorithm has its own notebook.
2. The neural networks are in each algorithm's notebook and the clustering of dim.red. are in each dim.red's notebook. 
2. sklearn library along with some basic Python data transformation libraries are used with matplotlib for plotting.
3. The datasets are not very large so I have put them in the same folder with the notebooks. The notebooks and datasets can be downloaded using this git command (The repository is public):

git clone https://github.com/okazkayasi/CS7641.git

4. To run any algorithm on any dataset, please open the corresponding notebook and run all cells in order (Run All can be done on Run tab).
