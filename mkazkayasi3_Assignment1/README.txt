1. In this assignment, I have used ipython notebooks, each algorithm-dataset pair is another indepenedent notebook to make it easier to run. 
2. sklearn library along with some basic Python data transformation libraries are used with matplotlib for plotting.
3. The datasets are not very large so I have put them in the same folder with the notebooks. The notebooks and datasets can be downloaded using this git command:

4. To run any algorithm on any dataset, please open the corresponding notebook and run all cells in order (Run All can be done on Run tab).
